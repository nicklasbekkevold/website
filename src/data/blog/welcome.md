Welcome all! In this post I will share some of my motivations for starting this blog and what my plans are.

## Why start a blog in 2025?

For me, a blog serves as a platform to freely express personal opinions. I value owning my own content, ensuring it isn't tied to any specific platform, and—perhaps best of all—having the freedom from big tech companies spying on me.

In a way, it's an antithesis to social media, though still a digital medium.

Another key reason is my background as a developer who builds websites for a living. This is a skill I which I value:

## Why write in English?

As many of you know, English functions as the lingua franca of the internet. This is particularly true in my field, computer science.

While I have plans to write future articles in my native Norwegian and possibly also in German, the rising quality of translation services should make this less of a problem, still allowing my content to reach a broader audience. But for now, I will write in English.

Welcome all! In this post I will share some of my motivations for starting this blog and what my plans are.

## Table of contents

## Why start a blog in 2025?

The simple answer is: why not? To me, a blog is a place where you can just share your opinions freely. I like the idea that I own my own content, it is not tied to a specific platform, and the best of all: no American company spying on you.

An antithesis to social media, if you will. Albeit, still a digital medium.

Another aspect is, as a developer who builds websites for a living, this is something I should have under control:

> This is something I should be able to do easily.

## Why write in English?

Well, as you know â€¦

I would like, however, to write upcoming articles in my native Norwegian, and possible in German. But for now, English.

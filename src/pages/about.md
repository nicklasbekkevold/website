Hi, I'm Nicklas! ðŸ‘‹

In my day-to-day work I work as head engineer at the Cancer Registry of Norway, part of the [Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH)](https://www.fhi.no/en/ab/departments-and-centres/registry-informatics/nicklas-imanuel-paus-bekkevold/).

Beyond my professional life, I like to stay active, drown in a well written book, or climb a mountain peak. I enjoy exploring new places and meeting interesting people, particularly in and around Germany, where I lived for nearly three years.

This blog is a space for me to share my thoughts and reflections on the intersection of science, technology, and society. I hope you find my insights interesting and engaging.
